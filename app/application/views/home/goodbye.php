              Unfortunately we are closing our doors. The interest in the service was not wide
              spread enough to the cover the operating costs. You can download your photos until we shutdown
              on <strong>October 1<sup>st</sup>, 2016</strong>. We will be permanently and securely deleting all data after this date.
              This includes account information, hashed passwords, email addresses, all pictures, and any other information
              that was stored in your account.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you signed up after <i>September 1<sup>st</sup></i>, we will automatically refund
              your purchase.
            </p>
            <p>
              Please reach out to <i>support@snapable.com</i> for any shutdown questions or help.
